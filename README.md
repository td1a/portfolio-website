Upon finishing the course I have clearly developed basic understanding of CSS.
There is no problem if I follow the videos and copy the code line by line.

I have been able to debug myself with online resources

The projects I have done so far:
1. The navbar design (successful when standalone)
2. A photo gallery, (successful when standalone)
3. A "Space Station" website, functional but only when 1:1 copying the codes from the instuctor.
4. A revamped "Space Station" website incorporating part 1 and 2 as modules.
