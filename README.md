The aim of the updated version of website is to demonstrate my knowledge in combining the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I added a game into the portfolio website in Gaming Section showing a Javascript game I developed.
This fulfills the requirement of the assignment.

During this module I have learned:
 - Syntax of Javascript
 - How to link Javascript into HTMLs
 - Several common methods of JS-HTML interaction, including getElementbyID or getElementsbyClass to get HTML elements as JS objects.
