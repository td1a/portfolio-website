Upon finishing the course I have clearly developed basic understanding of CSS.
There is no problem if I follow the videos and copy the code line by line.

However when I tried to paste codes from various projects there are troubles with arrangements.
My skill is not great enough for debugging freely at this stage and it is hugely inefficient to do so.
Apparently I still use the CSS language freely yet. At my level a traditional live tutorial with an experienced tutor would be very helpful.

The main problems are as follows:
1. I migrated the nav bar successfully. It is functional, however it is blocking "Home" section.
I want Home section to appear directly below navbar.

2. I want to use flex container for the gallery section. The flex photo frames appears to be successful in the independent project,
but it is intruding the next element which is the RSVP form. I don't know how to control it.

The projects I have done so far:
1. The navbar design (successful when standalone)
2. A photo gallery, (successful when standalone)
3. A "Space Station" website, functional but only when 1:1 copying the codes from the instuctor.
4. A revamped "Space Station" website aimed to be a integration of previous 3 however it is in trouble. (Depository URL:)
