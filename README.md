Upon finishing the course I have clearly developed basic understanding of CSS.
There is no problem if I follow the videos and copy the code line by line.

However when I tried to paste codes from various projects there are troubles with arrangements.
My skill is not great enough for debugging freely at this stage and it is inefficient to do so.
Apparently I still cannot use the CSS language freely yet. At my level a traditional live tutorial with an experienced tutor would be very helpful.

Some updates after hours of self learning:
1. I still cannot say I master the mapping of elements, especially when Flex is used.
   When multiple divs are nested, I am having trouble identifying which container controls what.
3. I cannot solve the text arrangement of an overlay.

The projects I have done so far:
1. The navbar design (successful when standalone)
2. A photo gallery, (successful when standalone)
3. A "Space Station" website, functional but only when 1:1 copying the codes from the instuctor.
4. A revamped "Space Station" website aimed to be a integration of previous 3 however it is in trouble. (Depository URL: https://github.com/td1a/HTML-and-CSS-assignments)
5. Some independent CSS concept learning through 3rd party website, to help me understand the how the concept works.
