Upon finishing the course I have clearly developed basic understanding of CSS.
There is no problem if I follow the videos and copy the code line by line.

I have been able to debug myself with online resources

The projects I have done so far:
1. The navbar design (successful when standalone)
2. A photo gallery, (successful when standalone)
   featured in Github depository: https://github.com/td1a/HTML-and-CSS-assignments
4. A "Space Station" website, functional but only when 1:1 copying the codes from the instuctor.
5. A revamped "Space Station" website incorporating part 1 and 2 as modules.
6. A slightly adapted portfolio website from the course
